# PokePortal
The PokePortal is a full-stack web application built with Flask, SQL Alchemy, Bootstrap, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The PokePortal gives its users an interactive experience to view Pokemon encounter locations in the Kalos region from Pokemon X & Y utilizing a network graph from the AnyChart javascript library. The map allows users to see what Pokemon spawn in specific landmarks through their journey in the game. In addition to a map page, the PokePortal contains a page to show the entire PokeDex for users to view more information about each Pokemon. Users are able to create an account to save which Pokemon they have caught in the game to add to their own personal collection. Finally, there is a search page to return Pokemon from your search query to view the information about them. If you are running this application for the first time you can run python3 app.py and load the local URL, and in the terminal, you should start to see numbers printing which means that the application is fetching the data needed to serve the website. There is also a ‘/configure_region’ endpoint that can be used to update the data fetched from the 3rd Party API used in this project. On this page you can type ‘kalos’ and the page will load a success on completion.
